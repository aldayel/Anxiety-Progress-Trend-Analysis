## Overview
This project is part of my ongoing work to enhance **A system and tool for treating anxiety in children**, a patented digital health system designed to provide personalized anxiety treatment for children. In this project, I analyze mental health trends among students to understand how anxiety, depression, and panic attacks correlate with academic and demographic factors. The insights gained from this analysis will help refine the system's ability to provide more effective, data-driven treatment recommendations.

## Objectives
- Apply data analysis skills to understand anxiety trends based on gender, academic performance (CGPA), and year of study.
- Explore the correlation between anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.
- Use the insights to enhance **A system and tool for treating anxiety in children**, ensuring better personalized treatment recommendations for children experiencing anxiety.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahasourav17/students-anxiety-and-depression-dataset).The dataset includes student responses about their mental health, covering aspects like anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and academic performance.

### Key Columns:
- **Gender**: Student gender (male/female).
- **Age**: Age of the student.
- **Year of Study**: Current year of study (e.g., Year 1, Year 2, etc.).
- **CGPA**: Student's academic performance (Grade Point Average).
- **Anxiety/Depression/Panic Attacks**: Self-reported answers on whether the student suffers from these mental health issues.

## Methodology
The project is broken down into several parts:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and standardizing the data.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Investigating trends and patterns in student mental health.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Exploring the relationship between anxiety, depression, and panic attacks, and identifying co-occurrence trends.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Generating visualizations using **Matplotlib** to showcase key insights and trends.

## Key Findings
- **Anxiety by Gender**: Female students reported higher levels of anxiety compared to male students.
- **Anxiety and CGPA**: Students with lower CGPAs tended to report more anxiety, suggesting a link between academic performance and mental health.
- **Anxiety and Panic Attacks**: There is a strong correlation between students who reported anxiety and those who also reported experiencing panic attacks.
  
These findings will help refine the treatment approaches used in my patented system to ensure that the treatment plans address both anxiety and co-occurring conditions like panic attacks.
